"Text": "In a late-night session of Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced a new version of the omnibus bill, a massive piece of legislation that deals with much of the federal governmentâ€™s funding. It now includes a version of CISA as well. Lumping CISA in with the omnibus bill further reduces any chance for debate over its surveillance-friendly provisions, or a White House veto. And the latest version actually chips away even further at the remaining personal information protections that privacy advocates had fought for in the version of the bill that passed the Senate."
